High level plan
-----------------
- clean up calc lib and make it sparkle
- write secant
- write secant/rectangle
- create an enticing homepage that expresses the wildthinks values
- fill out my current content
	- fractal
	- make exploding dots into a treasure hunt like rectangle
- design a calculus section for major results and proofs
	- definition of the derivative
	- chain rule
	- fundamental theorem of calculus
	- derivatives of sin and cos
	- derivative of e^x
	- derivatives of ln
	- limits (i only care about what happens close)
	- continuity


today's plan
--------------------
- SecantArray
- SecantRectangleArray

tomorrow plan
--------------------
- Update old pages with new library
- write down some specs I need based on my new storyline ideas. Unifying themes that need to repeat. How the chapter fit together



Unclassified
--------------------
- can I move textWidth to a globally accessible function and bind it's context?
- remove Xerror and Yerror from everything that has an xint.  
sliders can position relative to either endpoint
work on kiosk mode 
rectangles are for rate problems
is my code efficient?  How do we test this?
need an enum for types so I can easily add types without breaking old code.
not happy with the maxX function. fix it.
what can I do about the names initialization happening before super()?
- can we add units to work rectangle?
- rectangle4 remove jsxgraph copyright and do we need units?



Quick and Easy
-----------------
- I've messed up the formatting for header titles and subtitles
- bug in fly
- report problem of popup widths.  I'm currently using shadow to control the width.
- balance text is not updating, work total area for rect array is wrong sometimes.
- test all pages in different browsers.
- get a fucking favicon
- home page logo needs to scale for smaller screens
- map needs to rescale too
- add resources for fly problem



Larger Issues
------------------
- add code to detect phones and give a warning / message
- CNAME
- not sure that contact page is working
- NAVIGATION
	- navigation between pages
	- rectangle needs a navigation bar
	- once I have a navigation bar, the exploding dots pages could be broken down.
- rectangle resizing is off for medium screens.  This affects adding rectangles placement.
- would slowing down draw rate help performance for static periods of p5js?

HOME PAGE
- add featured video section?
- I need better branding
- revise the About section, About Andre, About Smartdown, About Wildthinks

ways to leave feedback
patreon page
logo work

- revise Relations
- plan my proof app


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branding
- I'm not going to baby people.  It will be what ever is interesting.  
- The goal is to push people to be creative.
- The goal is to allow people to explore.


secant rectangle
1. pick any secant, it has a corresponding rectangle
2. pick any rectangle, it has an infinte set of secants.
3. secant and rectangle are a pair.  They express the same relationship in different ways.
4. solve an area under curve problem without access to the total area.  Do a whole series of these. What would you do if you didn't have a way to add up the area?  

- ask Lego robotics folks to try out my web page.
- ask Nicky case to add me to the explorable explanation website
- ask James Tanton for feedback
- epsilon stream
- Kiki Prottsman
- Aran Clauson 
- JSXGraph folks
- local highschool teachers
