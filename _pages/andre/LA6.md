### Linear Transformations

![fullwidth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3)

A **transformation** (or **function** or **mapping**) $T$ from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a rule that assigns to each vector ${\bf x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ a vector $T({\bf x})$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$.  The set $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called the **domain** of $T$, and $\mathbb{R}^m$ is called the **codomain** of $T$.  The vector $T({\bf x})$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called the **image** of ${\bf x}$ (under the action of $T$).  The set of all images $T({\bf x})$ is called the **range** of $T$.

**Definition** A transformation (or mapping) $T$ is **linear** if :
 - $T({\bf u} + {\bf v}) = T({\bf u}) + T({\bf v})$ for all ${\bf u}$, ${\bf v}$ in the domain of $T$;
 - $T(c{\bf u}) = cT({\bf u})$ for all scalars $c$ and all ${\bf u}$ in the domain of $T$.
