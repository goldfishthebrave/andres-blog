### Informal Limits

We've looked at a few limit examples and we've developed this informal description of a limit:

# --outlinebox ob_limit
**Informal Description of a Limit**
Say we have a function $f(x)$.  The limit of $f(x)$ at some point $x=a$ is the value the function gets close to as $x$ gets very close but remains distinct from $a$.  
# --outlinebox

We've learned that: 
1. The limit of a function at a point usually matches the value of the function at that point.   
2. There are weird functions where the limit at point is different than the value at the point.  
3. There are definitely functions where the limit at a point may be undefined.  

In calculus, some of the most important functions are undefined right at the point where we need their value the most. Fortunately, the limit at these points often does exists and has a real value. We'll see that in these cases, limits can really help us out of a jam. 

From here you have a choice.  You can stick with an informal understanding of limits and move on to the lesson on [derivatives](/pages/symbols1), or you can learn more about limits in the lesson on [epsilon delta proofs](/pages/limitDEIntro). 

A few thoughts before you choose.

1. An informal understanding of limits sufficed in the study of calculus for 150 years.  Read this fabulous [quote from mathematician James Tanton](::tantonOnLimits/center,draggable,closeable) on this topic.

2. The section on epsilon delta proofs is much more intuitive and entertaining when done with interactive explanations than it is in a normal text book where it's usually a bit tedious.

**On the study of limits in highschool calculus:**
"... Many programs give the impression that this material is a precursor to rigor and technical precision, but, in the end, appeal to intuition over and over again. A student who thinks deeply is given the impression that a foundation is laid, but one with no cement or stone and therefore no real means to support a structure of any weight.
At this stage of the discussion, the notion of a “limit” should indeed be informal. In fact, the creators of calculus during the 1500s and 1600s did not think in terms of limits and found that intuition sufficed for the development at hand, compelling the subject onward in all its glory. It was only some 150 years later, after the subject was fully developed, that folk began to dig deeply into the foundations of the subject and begin to question beginning thoughts. What does it mean to be “continuous” exactly? What does a “leap of faith” really mean? Mathematicians at that time started to push the theory of calculus towards extreme situations (Does it work for the bizarre function that equals 1 for all rational numbers and 0 for all irrational numbers?) Troubles started to appear and so mathematicians had to resort to absolute technical clarity. French mathematician Augustine-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) proposed the notion of a limit, and the full technical rigor for it was developed by Karl Weierstrass (1815-97).
The standard high-school curriculum does not present the problems that call for precise formulation of a limit, nor does it present the technical definition that goes with it! There is a half-hearted attempt to be “precise,” which, in the end is only confusing. "
