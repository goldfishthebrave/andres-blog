### OK, we need to talk

We've looked at one example and we've developed this informal description of a limit:

# --outlinebox ob_limit
**Informal Description of a Limit**
Say we have a function $f(x)$.  The limit of $f(x)$ at some point $x=a$ is the value the function gets close to as $x$ gets very close but remains distinct from $a$.  
# --outlinebox


In our example, the value of the function at $x=1$ was not the same as the limit of the function at $x=1$. Usually the limit of a function at a point matches the value of the function at that point. These kinds of weird functions with holes in them don't occur in real world functions very often and you can do a lot of math without ever having to worry about these kinds of things.  You could replace the function $f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ with the function $f(x) = x + 1$.  It's the same function only without the hole.  However, this kind of weird function happens in calculus right in the middle of the first important definition.

**Remember**
The value of a function at a point may not be the same as the limit of the function at that point.
