# Goldfish and Robin Videos on Exploding Dots
Here are all 23 of Goldfish and Robin's exploding dots videos. 

## Introducing the 1 $\leftarrow$ 2 Machine
The Goldfish and Robin crew introduce the base 2 machine.  Checkout the giant machine with people dots!

## Introducing the 1 $\leftarrow$ 3 Machine
May and Rae introduce the base 3 machine.

## Explaining the 1 $\leftarrow$ 2 Machine
Goldfish and Robin delve deeper into the base 2 machine and show how to translate base 2 numbers back to base 10.  Also, there's a great commercial for base 2 birthday candles at the end.  Also, cute spotted California ground squirrels.

## Explaining the 1 $\leftarrow$ 3 Machine
Goldfish, Aliyah and Vanilla the rabbit explain how to work backwards in a base 3 machine to translate base 3 numbers back into base 10 numbers.  Also, random bunny time and ukelele playing.

## Exploding Dots Addition
Goldfish and Robin explain how to do addition in any base and compare the exploding dots way of doing addition to the standard base 10 algorithm we learn in school.  There are also bunny cameos and Shadow bunny eating strawberry exploding dots.  Wait for it.  It's at the end.

## Antidots
What are antidots?  You need them for subtraction.

## Subtraction

Goldfish and Robin show how to do exploding dots subtraction.  It's more fun if you can eat the dots when they annihilate.

## Does Order Matter?
This is the first of two videos exploring whether the order of explosions affects the code that is generated in a base 2 machine.  Goldfish and Robin are joined by James Tanton to try and puzzle it out.  They do lots of thinking and eat lots of bananas and make good progress on the problem.

## Does Order Matter (Part 2)
Goldfish and Robin try to finish up their thinking on whether the order of explosions matters.  They draw the explosions as they happen creating a trace.  This way they can compare and reason about the different choices for order.  Also Goldfish makes a stop motion animation of the explosions that took a really long time to make.

## Goldfish gets Creative with the Distributive Property

Exploding dots makes it easier for people to be creative and come up with their own strategies for doing arithmetic.  In this video, Goldfish talks about the distributive property and how he uses it to find easy and creative ways to multiply multi digit numbers.

## Division and Multiplication are Inverses
Goldfish and Robin show how multiplication and division are inverses, exploding dots style.  Also, check out the player piano in the outro.
